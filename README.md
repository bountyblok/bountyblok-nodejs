**This library allows you to easily use the bountblok.io APIs via Node.js.**

bountyblok.io is a gamification engine build and powered by the EOS blockchain.

This library is a quick and easy way to Log tasks for challenges as well as retrieve progresses/badges/achievements and more. We will keep updating this library to expose our API calls in the future!

Thanks for your support!

# Introduction - Please Read First

This library is broken up into several packages as a monorepo so that you only need to install the packages necessary for your use case. This README contains information about all packages. For examples on how to get started quickly, head over to the READMEs of each package (linked and described below), which includes detailed examples.


# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version 6, 7 or 8

## Obtain an API Key

Grab your API Key from the [bountyblok.io UI](https://app.bountyblok.io/settings/api_keys).

## Install Package

The following recommended installation requires [npm](https://npmjs.org/). If you are unfamiliar with npm, see the [npm docs](https://npmjs.org/doc/). Npm comes installed with Node.js since node version 0.8.x, therefore, you likely already have it.

```sh
npm install --save @bountyblok/client
```

You may also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install.

yarn add @bountyblok/client
```
