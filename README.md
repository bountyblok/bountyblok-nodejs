**This library allows you to easily use the bountblok.io APIs via Node.js.**

bountyblok.io is a gamification engine build and powered by the EOS blockchain.

This library is a quick and easy way to Log tasks for challenges as well as retrieve progresses/badges/achievements and more. We will keep updating this library to expose our API calls in the future!

Thanks for your support!
